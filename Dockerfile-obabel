# The user would normally mount a volume with their own execute
# script in it and then set the WORKDIR to the directory it's in.
# In its absence we just run the built-in 'execute',
# which is expected to echo some descriptive/helpful text.
#
# The default 'execute' relies on an ENV to name the pipeline it's in,
# which can be defined with the docker 'pipeline' build argument.
